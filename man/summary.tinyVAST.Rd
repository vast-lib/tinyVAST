\description{
summarize parameters from a fitted tinyVAST
}
\details{
tinyVAST includes an "arrow and lag" notation, which specifies the set of
path coefficients and exogenous variance parameters to be estimated. Function \code{fit}
then estimates the maximum likelihood value for those coefficients and parameters
by maximizing the log-marginal likelihood.

However, many users will want to associate individual parameters and standard errors
with the path coefficients that were specified using the "arrow and lag" notation.
This task is complicated in
models where some path coefficients or variance parameters are specified to share a single value a priori,
or were assigned a name of NA and hence assumed to have a fixed value a priori (such that
these coefficients or parameters have an assigned value but no standard error).
The \code{summary} function therefore compiles the MLE for coefficients (including duplicating
values for any path coefficients that assigned the same value) and standard error
estimates, and outputs those in a table that associates them with the user-supplied path and parameter names.
It also outputs the z-score and a p-value arising from a two-sided Wald test (i.e.
comparing the estimate divided by standard error against a standard normal distribution).
