	abstract = {Summary.  Continuously indexed Gaussian fields (GFs) are the most important ingredient in spatial statistical modelling and geostatistics. The specification through the covariance function gives an intuitive interpretation of the field properties. On the computational side, GFs are hampered with the big n problem, since the cost of factorizing dense matrices is cubic in the dimension. Although computational power today is at an all time high, this fact seems still to be a computational bottleneck in many applications. Along with GFs, there is the class of Gaussian Markov random fields (GMRFs) which are discretely indexed. The Markov property makes the precision matrix involved sparse, which enables the use of numerical algorithms for sparse matrices, that for fields in  only use the square root of the time required by general algorithms. The specification of a GMRF is through its full conditional distributions but its marginal properties are not transparent in such a parameterization. We show that, using an approximate stochastic weak solution to (linear) stochastic partial differential equations, we can, for some GFs in the Matérn class, provide an explicit link, for any triangulation of , between GFs and GMRFs, formulated as a basis function representation. The consequence is that we can take the best from the two worlds and do the modelling by using GFs but do the computations by using GMRFs. Perhaps more importantly, our approach generalizes to other covariance functions generated by SPDEs, including oscillating and non-stationary GFs, as well as GFs on manifolds. We illustrate our approach by analysing global temperature data with a non-stationary model defined on a sphere.},

	abstract = {Multivariate data reduction techniques are widely used to describe modes of variability in atmospheric and oceanographic conditions for the world’s oceans. Dominant modes of variability such as the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) are typically defined as a statistical summary of physical measurements, and include both principle components representing modes of variability over time, and an empirical orthogonal function (EOF) giving the spatial pattern associated with a positive or negative phase for each mode. Typically, these indices are compared with biological conditions to describe or predict physical drivers of ecological dynamics. In some circumstances, however, it may instead be useful to apply EOF analysis directly to biological measurements, estimating indices of biological variability as well as maps of biological response associated with each index. We therefore develop a generalization of EOF analysis that can be applied directly to multispecies biological samples using a multivariate spatio-temporal model. These biologically derived indices can then be compared with relevant indices derived from physical data, or used as covariates in spatially-varying coefficient models. We first show that a spatio-temporal model can replicate previous EOF estimates of the PDO and North Pacific Gyre Oscillation. We then identify three axes of variability in the eastern Bering Sea using biomass-sampling data for fourteen bottom-associated fishes and decapod crustaceans from 1982 to 2017. The first axis represents habitat preferences that are stable over time, and the second represents a multi-decadal trend in distribution for most species; for example, showing an increasing density for Alaska skate and arrowtooth flounder in the middle and inner domain. Finally, the third axis shows high interannual variability from 1982 to 1998 switching to multiyear stanzas from 1999 to 2017 and is highly correlated (0.87) with the extent of the cold bottom temperatures in this region and associated impacts on Alaska pollock and Pacific cod. These axes represent ecological dynamics for adult fishes and therefore integrate the impact of bottom-up and top-down processes, and they also confirm the importance of cold-pool extent for fish distribution in the Bering Sea while visualizing its varied impact on individual species. Moreover, this spatio-temporal approach allows oceanographers to define annual indices representing modes of variability in diverse biological communities from widely available field-sampling data.},

Examples include the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, summarizing annual variation in the location of warm waters in the North Pacific, and cold-pool extent (CPE), summarizing the area with cold near-bottom waters in the eastern Bering Sea. However, these indices are rarely included in the species distribution models that are used to identify and forecast distribution shifts under future climate scenarios. I therefore review three interpretations of spatially varying coefficient models, explain how they can be used to estimate spatial patterns of population density associated with oceanographic indices, and add this option to the multivariate spatiotemporal model VAST. I then use a case study involving bottom trawl data for 17 fish and decapod species in the eastern Bering Sea 1982–2017 to answer: does a spatially varying coefficient model for CPE explain variation in spatial distribution for species in this region? And (2) does a spatially varying effect of CPE remain substantial even when local temperature is also included as a covariate? Results show that CPE and local bottom temperature are both identified as parsimonious by Akaike Information Criterion for 13 of 17 species, jointly explain nearly 9\%–14\% of spatiotemporal variation on average, and CPE does explain variation in excess of local temperature alone. I therefore conclude that spatially varying coefficient models are a useful way to assimilate oceanographic indices within species distribution models, and hypothesize that these will be useful to account for decadal-scale variability within multidecadal forecasts of distribution shift.},

Species distributions can be estimated using geostatistical methods, which estimate a latent spatial variable explaining observed variation in densities, but geostatistical methods may be imprecise for species with low densities or few observations. Additionally, simple geostatistical methods fail to account for correlations in distribution among species and generally estimate such cross-correlations as a post hoc exercise.

We also derive an analytic estimate of cross-correlations among species from SFA parameters.

As a second case study, we show that forward prediction of catches for 20 rockfishes (Sebastes spp.) off the U.S. West Coast is more accurate using SFA than analysing each species individually. Finally, we show that single-species models give a different picture of cross-correlations than joint estimation using SFA.

Ecologists have aimed to estimate density dependence in population and community data by fitting a simple autoregressive (Gompertz) model for density dependence to time series of abundance for an entire population. However, it is increasingly recognized that spatial heterogeneity in population densities has implications for population and community dynamics. We therefore adapt the Gompertz model to approximate local densities over continuous space instead of population-wide abundance, and allow productivity to vary spatially using Gaussian random fields. We then show that the conventional (nonspatial) Gompertz model can result in biased estimates of density dependence (e.g., identifying oscillatory dynamics when not present) if densities vary spatially. By contrast, the spatial Gompertz model provides accurate and precise estimates of density dependence for a variety of simulation scenarios and data availabilities. These results are corroborated when comparing spatial and nonspatial models for data from 10 years and {\textasciitilde}100 sampling stations for three long-lived rockfishes (Sebastes spp.) off the California, USA coast. In this case, the nonspatial model estimates implausible oscillatory dynamics on an annual time scale, while the spatial model estimates strong autocorrelation and is supported by model selection tools. We conclude by discussing the importance of improved data archiving techniques, so that spatial models can be used to reexamine classic questions regarding the existence and magnitude of density dependence in wild populations.},

Spatial analysis of the distribution and density of species is of continuing interest within theoretical and applied ecology. Species distribution models (SDMs) are being increasingly used to analyse count, presence–absence and presence-only data sets. There is a growing literature on dynamic SDMs (which incorporate temporal variation in species distribution), joint SDMs (which simultaneously analyse the correlated distribution of multiple species) and geostatistical models (which account for similarity between nearby sites caused by unobserved covariates). However, no previous study has combined all three attributes within a single framework.


Innovation

We develop spatial dynamic factor analysis for use as a ‘joint, dynamic SDM’ (JDSDM), which uses geostatistical methods to account for spatial similarity when estimating one or more ‘factors’. Each factor evolves over time following a density-dependent (Gompertz) process, and the log-density of each species is approximated as a linear combination of different factors. We demonstrate a JDSDM using two multispecies case studies (an annual survey of bottom-associated species in the Bering Sea and a seasonal survey of butterfly density in the continental USA), and also provide our code publicly as an R package.


Main conclusions

Case study applications show that that JDSDMs can be used for species ordination, i.e. showing that dynamics for butterfly species within the same genus are significantly more correlated than for species from different genera. We also demonstrate how JDSDMs can rapidly identify dominant patterns in community dynamics, including the decline and recovery of several Bering Sea fishes since 2008, and the ‘flight curves’ typical of early or late-emerging butterflies. We conclude by suggesting future research that could incorporate phylogenetic relatedness or functional similarity, and propose that our approach could be used to monitor community dynamics at large spatial and temporal scales.},

	abstract = {Niche-based approaches to community analysis often involve estimating a matrix of pairwise interactions among species (the “community matrix”), but this task becomes infeasible using observational data as the number of modeled species increases. As an alternative, neutral theories achieve parsimony by assuming that species within a trophic level are exchangeable, but generally cannot incorporate stabilizing interactions even when they are evident in field data. Finally, both regulated (niche) and unregulated (neutral) approaches have rarely been fitted directly to survey data using spatiotemporal statistical methods. We therefore propose a spatiotemporal and model-based approach to estimate community dynamics that are partially regulated. Specifically, we start with a neutral spatiotemporal model where all species follow ecological drift, which precludes estimating pairwise interactions. We then add regulatory relations until model selection favors stopping, where the “rank” of the interaction matrix may range from zero to the number of species. A simulation experiment shows that model selection can accurately identify the rank of the interaction matrix, and that the identified spatiotemporal model can estimate the magnitude of species interactions. A 40-yr case study for the Gulf of St. Lawrence marine community shows that recovering grey seals have an unregulated and negative relationship with demersal fishes. We therefore conclude that partial regulation is a plausible approximation to community dynamics using field data and hypothesize that estimating partial regulation will be expedient in future analyses of spatiotemporal community dynamics given limited field data. We conclude by recommending ongoing research to add explicit models for movement, so that meta-community theory can be confronted with data in a spatiotemporal statistical framework.},

	abstract = {Population dynamics are often correlated in space and time due to correlations in environmental drivers as well as synchrony induced by individual dispersal. Many statistical analyses of populations ignore potential autocorrelations and assume that survey methods (distance and time between samples) eliminate these correlations, allowing samples to be treated independently. If these assumptions are incorrect, results and therefore inference may be biased and uncertainty underestimated. We developed a novel statistical method to account for spatiotemporal correlations within dendritic stream networks, while accounting for imperfect detection in the surveys. Through simulations, we found this model decreased predictive error relative to standard statistical methods when data were spatially correlated based on stream distance and performed similarly when data were not correlated. We found that increasing the number of years surveyed substantially improved the model accuracy when estimating spatial and temporal correlation coefficients, especially from 10 to 15 yr. Increasing the number of survey sites within the network improved the performance of the nonspatial model but only marginally improved the density estimates in the spatiotemporal model. We applied this model to brook trout data from the West Susquehanna Watershed in Pennsylvania collected over 34 yr from 1981 to 2014. We found the model including temporal and spatiotemporal autocorrelation best described young of the year (YOY) and adult density patterns. YOY densities were positively related to forest cover and negatively related to spring temperatures with low temporal autocorrelation and moderately high spatiotemporal correlation. Adult densities were less strongly affected by climatic conditions and less temporally variable than YOY but with similar spatiotemporal correlation and higher temporal autocorrelation.},

	abstract = {Multispecies models are widely used to evaluate management trade-offs arising from species interactions. However, identifying climate impacts and sensitive habitats requires integrating spatial heterogeneity and environmental impacts into multispecies models at fine spatial scales. We therefore develop a spatio-temporal model of intermediate complexity for ecosystem assessments (a “MICE-in-space”), which is fitted to survey sampling data and time series of fishing mortality using maximum-likelihood techniques. The model is implemented in the VAST R package, and it can be configured to range from purely descriptive to including ratio-dependent interactions among species. We demonstrate this model using data for four groundfishes in the Gulf of Alaska using data from 1982 to 2015. Model selection for this case-study shows that models with species interactions are parsimonious, although a model specifying separate density dependence without interactions also has substantial support. The AIC-selected model estimates a significant, negative impact of Alaska pollock (Gadus chalcogrammus, Gadidae) on productivity of other species and suggests that recent fishing mortality for Pacific cod (G. microcephalus, Gadidae) is above the biological reference point (BRP) resulting in 40\% of unfished biomass; other models show similar trends but different scales due to different BRP estimates. A simulation experiment shows that fitting a model with fewer species at a coarse spatial resolution degrades estimation performance, but that interactions and biological reference points can still be estimated accurately. We conclude that MICE-in-space models can simultaneously estimate fishing impacts, species trade-offs, biological reference points and habitat quality. They are therefore suitable to forecast short-term climate impacts, optimize survey designs and designate protected habitats.},

However, there is no statistical method for processing stomach content data that accounts for fine-scale spatio-temporal structure while expanding individual stomach samples to population-level estimates of predation. Therefore, we developed an approach that fits a spatio-temporal model to both prey-biomass-per-predator-biomass data (i.e. the ratio of prey biomass in stomachs to predator weight) and predator biomass survey data, to predict “predator-expanded-stomach-contents” (PESCs). PESC estimates can be used to visualize either the annual landscape of PESCs (spatio-temporal variation), or can be aggregated across space to calculate annual variation in diet proportions (variation among prey items and among years). We demonstrated our approach in two contrasting scenarios: a data-rich situation involving eastern Bering Sea (EBS) large-size walleye pollock (Gadus chalcogrammus, Gadidae) for 1992–2015; and a data-limited situation involving West Florida Shelf red grouper (Epinephelus morio, Epinephelidae) for 2011–2015. Large walleye pollock PESC was predicted to be higher in very warm years on the Middle Shelf of the EBS, where food is abundant. Red grouper PESC was variable in north-western Florida waters, presumably due to spatio-temporal variation in harmful algal bloom severity. Our approach can be employed to parameterize or validate diverse ecosystem models, and can serve to address many fundamental ecological questions, such as providing an improved understanding of how climate-driven changes in spatial overlap between predator and prey distributions might influence predation pressure.},

Research has developed spatiotemporal methods to estimate abundance indices, but there is little research regarding model-based methods to generate age–length–sex composition data. We demonstrate a spatiotemporal approach to generate composition data and a multinomial sample size that approximates the estimated imprecision. A simulation experiment comparing spatiotemporal and design-based methods demonstrates a 32\% increase in input sample size for the spatiotemporal estimator. A Stock Synthesis assessment used to manage lingcod (Ophiodon elongatus) in the California Current also shows a 17\% increase in sample size and better model fit using the spatiotemporal estimator, resulting in smaller standard errors when estimating spawning biomass.

Our main result is that a SAR model can be written as a unique CAR model, and while a CAR model can be written as a SAR model, it is not unique. In fact, we show how any multivariate Gaussian distribution on a finite set of points with a positive-definite covariance matrix can be written as either a CAR or a SAR model. We illustrate how to obtain any number of SAR covariance matrices from a single CAR covariance matrix by using Givens rotation matrices on a simulated example. We also discuss sparseness in the original CAR construction, and for the resulting SAR weights matrix. For a real example, we use crime data in 49 neighborhoods from Columbus, Ohio, and show that a geostatistical model optimizes the likelihood much better than typical first-order CAR models. We then use the implied weights from the geostatistical model to estimate CAR model parameters that provides the best overall optimization.},

	abstract = {Species distribution models (SDMs) are widely used to relate species occurrence and density to local environmental conditions, and often include a spatially correlated variable to account for spatial patterns in residuals. Ecologists have extended SDMs to include spatially varying coefficients (SVCs), where the response to a given covariate varies smoothly over space and time. However, SVCs see relatively little use perhaps because they remain less known relative to other SDM techniques. We therefore review ecological contexts where SVCs can improve the interpretability and descriptive power from SDMs, including local responses to regional indices that represent ecological teleconnections; density-dependent habitat selection; spatially varying detectability; and context-dependent covariate responses that represent interactions with unmeasured covariates. We then illustrate three additional examples in detail using the vector autoregressive spatio-temporal (VAST) model. First, a spatially varying decadal trends model identifies decadal trends for arrowtooth flounder Atheresthes stomias density in the Bering Sea from 1982 to 2019. Second, a trait-based joint SDM highlights the role of body size and temperature in spatial community assembly in the Gulf of Alaska. Third, an age-structured SDM for walleye pollock Gadus chalcogrammus in the Bering Sea contrasts cohorts with broad spatial distributions (1996 and 2009) and those that are more spatially constrained (2002 and 2015). We conclude that SVCs extend SDMs to address a wide variety of ecological contexts and can be used to better understand a range of ecological processes, e.g. density dependence, community assembly and population dynamics.},

We developed a spatio-temporal modelling framework that integrates research survey data (treated as a “reference dataset”) and other data sources (“non-reference datasets”) while estimating spatially varying catchability for the non-reference datasets. We demonstrated it using two case studies. The first involved bottom trawl survey and observer data for spiny dogfish (Squalus acanthias) on the Chatham Rise, New Zealand. The second involved cod predators as samplers of juvenile snow crab (Chionoecetes opilio) abundance, integrated with industry-cooperative surveys and a bottom trawl research survey in the eastern Bering Sea. Our integrated models leveraged the strengths of individual data sources (the quality of the reference dataset and the quantity of non-reference data), while downweighting the influence of the non-reference datasets via the estimated spatially varying catchabilities. They allowed for the generation of annual density maps for a longer time-period and for the provision of one single index rather than multiple indices each covering a shorter time-period.},

	abstract = {Ecological analyses typically involve many interacting variables. Ecologists often specify lagged interactions in community dynamics (i.e. vector-autoregressive models) or simultaneous interactions (e.g. structural equation models), but there is less familiarity with dynamic structural equation models (DSEM) that can include any simultaneous or lagged effect in multivariate time-series analysis. We propose a novel approach to parameter estimation for DSEM, which involves constructing a Gaussian Markov random field (GMRF) representing simultaneous and lagged path coefficients, and then fitting this as a generalized linear mixed model to missing and/or non-normal data. We provide a new R-package dsem, which extends the ‘arrow interface’ from path analysis to represent user-specified lags when constructing the GMRF. We also outline how the resulting nonseparable precision matrix can generalize existing separable models, for example, for time-series and species interactions in a vector-autoregressive model. We first demonstrate dsem by simulating a two-species vector-autoregressive model based on wolf–moose interactions on Isle Royale. We show that DSEM has improved precision when data are missing relative to a conventional dynamic linear model. We then demonstrate DSEM via two contrasting case studies. The first identifies a trophic cascade where decreased sunflower starfish has increased urchin and decreased kelp densities, while sea otters have a simultaneous positive effect on kelp in the California Current from 1999 to 2018. The second estimates how declining sea ice has decreased cold-water habitats, driving a decreased density for fall copepod predation and inhibiting early-life survival for Alaska pollock from 1963 to 2023. We conclude that DSEM can be fitted efficiently as a GLMM involving missing data, while allowing users to specify both simultaneous and lagged effects in a time-series structural model. DSEM then allows conceptual models (developed with stakeholder input or from ecological expertise) to be fitted to incomplete time series and provides a simple interface for granular control over the number of estimated time-series parameters. Finally, computational methods are sufficiently simple that DSEM can be embedded as component within larger (e.g. integrated population) models. We therefore recommend greater exploration and performance testing for DSEM relative to familiar time-series forecasting methods.},

However, appropriate models to analyse these data, such as generalised linear mixed effects models (GLMMs) with Gaussian Markov random fields (GMRFs), are computationally intensive and challenging for many users to implement. Here, we introduce the R package sdmTMB, which extends the flexible interface familiar to users of lme4, glmmTMB, and mgcv to include spatial and spatiotemporal latent GMRFs using an SPDE-(stochastic partial differential equation) based approach. SPDE matrices are constructed with fmesher and estimation is conducted via maximum marginal likelihood with TMB or via Bayesian inference with tmbstan and rstan. We describe the model and explore case studies that illustrate sdmTMB’s flexibility in implementing penalised smoothers, non-stationary processes (time-varying and spatially varying coefficients), hurdle models, cross-validation and anisotropy (directionally dependent spatial correlation). Finally, we compare the functionality, speed, and interfaces of related software, demonstrating that sdmTMB can be an order of magnitude faster than R-INLA. We hope sdmTMB will help open this useful class of models to a wider field of geostatistical analysts.},

	abstract = {Aim Multivariate spatio-temporal models are widely applicable, but specifying their structure is complicated and may inhibit wider use. We introduce the R package tinyVAST from two viewpoints: the software user and the statistician. Innovation From the user viewpoint, tinyVAST adapts a widely used formula interface to specify generalised additive models and combines this with arguments to specify spatial and spatio-temporal interactions among variables. These interactions are specified using arrow notation (from structural equation models) or an extended arrow-and-lag notation that allows simultaneous, lagged and recursive dependencies among variables over time. The user also specifies a spatial domain for areal (gridded), continuous (point-count) or stream-network data. From the statistician viewpoint, tinyVAST constructs sparse precision matrices representing multivariate spatio-temporal variation, and parameters are estimated by specifying a generalised linear mixed model (GLMM). This expressive interface encompasses vector autoregressive, empirical orthogonal functions, spatial factor analysis and ARIMA models. Main Conclusion To demonstrate, we fit to data from two survey platforms sampling corals, sponges, rockfishes and flatfishes in the Gulf of Alaska and Aleutian Islands. We then compare eight alternative model structures using different assumptions about habitat drivers and survey detectability. Model selection suggests that towed-camera and bottom trawl gears have spatial variation in detectability but sample the same underlying density of flatfishes and rockfishes and that rockfishes are positively associated with sponges while flatfishes are negatively associated with corals. We conclude that tinyVAST can be used to test complicated dependencies representing alternative structural hypotheses for research and real-world policy evaluation.},

	abstract = {Spatio-temporal species distribution models (SDMs) are valuable tools to support fisheries management, as they account for long-term and time-varying unmeasured variation (spatial and spatio-temporal variation), thereby providing more accurate and statistically efficient estimates than simpler SDMs. However, the application of spatio-temporal SDMs for probabilistic forecasts of fish abundances has been slowed by two main challenges. First, guidance surrounding the decisions needed to generate forecasts with a spatio-temporal SDM is lacking. Second, there is limited functionality to efficiently produce forecasts with spatio-temporal SDMs while also propagating uncertainty about initial conditions and process errors. We developed new approaches to forecasting with spatio-temporal SDMs, which allow for efficient predictions with spatio-temporal SDMs and quantifying the influence of different model components on prediction uncertainty. We illustrate our approaches with two contrasting applications: west coast New Zealand snapper (Chrysophrys auratus), using fisheries data and examining retrospective forecasts; and Bering Sea capelin (Mallotus villosus), employing fisheries-independent data and generating forecasts to 2100. The applications showed that spatio-temporal variation should be included in spatio-temporal SDMs to produce forecasts, to explain a much larger fraction of the variability in the data, thereby providing more accurate reconstructions of population trends and better characterising uncertainty around forecasts. Our results also highlight that forecasts with spatio-temporal SDMs work best in data-rich situations, particularly if the time series of fish data is relatively long. Our approaches can help unlock the use of spatio-temporal SDMs to make both near-term and long-term forecasts, providing better information to fisheries managers and informing future data collection.},
